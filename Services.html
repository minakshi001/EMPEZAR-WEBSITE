            <p>The concept of warehousing of goods in a duty-free area (SEZ) has emerged as a key factor in logistics and global supply chain system servicing.

                Mundra has rapidly emerged as a leading international trading hub, owing to superior infrastructure and its strategic location – cargo consolidation and distribution to the Indian sub continent, South East Asia, Middle East, CIS and Africa.
